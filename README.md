**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

The **[Databricks Lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/)** provides one simple platform to unify all your data, analytics and AI workloads.

# dbt-databricks

The `dbt-databricks` adapter contains all of the code enabling dbt to work with Databricks. This adapter is based off the amazing work done in [dbt-spark](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark). Some key features include:

- **Easy setup**. No need to install an ODBC driver as the adapter uses pure Python APIs.
- **Open by default**. For example, it uses the the open and performant [Delta](https://delta.io/) table format by default. This has many benefits, including letting you use `MERGE` as the the default incremental materialization strategy.
- **Support for Unity Catalog**. dbt-databricks>=1.1.1 supports the 3-level namespace of Unity Catalog (catalog / schema / relations) so you can organize and secure your data the way you like.
- **Performance**. The adapter generates SQL expressions that are automatically accelerated by the native, vectorized [Photon](https://databricks.com/product/photon) execution engine.

## Choosing between dbt-databricks and dbt-spark
If you are developing a dbt project on Databricks, we recommend using `dbt-databricks` for the reasons noted above.

`dbt-spark` is an actively developed adapter which works with Databricks as well as Apache Spark anywhere it is hosted e.g. on AWS EMR.
