# **what?**
# Runs code quality checks, unit tests, and verifies python build on
# all code commited to the repository. This workflow should not
# require any secrets since it runs for PRs from forked repos.
# By default, secrets are not passed to workflows running from
# a forked repo.

# **why?**
# Ensure code for dbt meets a certain quality standard.

# **when?**
# This will run for all PRs, when code is pushed to a release
# branch, and when manually triggered.
