## dbt-databricks 1.3.0 (October 14, 2022)

### Features

- Support python model through run command API, currently supported materializations are table and incremental. ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#377](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/377), [#126](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/126))
- Enable Pandas and Pandas-on-Spark DataFrames for dbt python models ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#469](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/469), [#181](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/181))
- Support job cluster in notebook submission method ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#467](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/467), [#194](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/194))
  - In `all_purpose_cluster` submission method, a config `http_path` can be specified in Python model config to switch the cluster where Python model runs.
    ```py
    def model(dbt, _):
        dbt.config(
            materialized='table',
            http_path='...'
        )
        ...
    ```
- Use builtin timestampadd and timestampdiff functions for dateadd/datediff macros if available ([#185](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/185))

### Under the hood

- Apply "Initial refactoring of incremental materialization" ([#148](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/148))
  - Now dbt-databricks uses `adapter.get_incremental_strategy_macro` instead of `dbt_spark_get_incremental_sql` macro to dispatch the incremental strategy macro. The overwritten `dbt_spark_get_incremental_sql` macro will not work anymore.
- Better interface for python submission ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#452](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/452), [#178](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/178))

  - The full parameters are listed at [Databricks SQL Connector for Python](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/python-sql-connector.html#connect-method).
  - Currently, the following parameters are reserved for `dbt-databricks`. Please use the normal credential settings instead.
    - server_hostname
    - http_path
    - access_token
    - session_configuration
    - catalog
    - schema

### Fixes

- Incremental materialization updated to not drop table first if full refresh for delta lake format, as it already runs _create or replace table_ ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#286](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/286), [dbt-labs/dbt-spark#287](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/287))

### Under the hood

- Update `SparkColumn.numeric_type` to return `decimal` instead of `numeric`, since SparkSQL exclusively supports the former ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#380](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/380))
- Make minimal changes to support dbt Core incremental materialization refactor ([dbt-labs/dbt-spark#402](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issue/402), [dbt-labs/dbt-spark#394](httpe://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/pull/394), [#136](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/136))
- Add new basic tests `TestDocsGenerateDatabricks` and `TestDocsGenReferencesDatabricks` ([#134](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/134))
- Set upper bound for `databricks-sql-connector` when Python 3.10 ([#154](https://github.com/databricks/dbt-databricks/pull/154))
  - Note that `databricks-sql-connector` does not officially support Python 3.10 yet.

  - Setting an initial catalog with `session_properties` is deprecated and will not work in the future release. Please use `catalog` or `database` to set the initial catalog.
  - When using catalog, `spark_build_snapshot_staging_table` macro will not be used. If trying to override the macro, `databricks_build_snapshot_staging_table` should be overridden instead.

### Fixes

- Enhanced get_columns_in_relation method to handle a bug in open source deltalake which doesnt return schema details in `show table extended in databasename like '*'` query output.

- Parse properly columns when there are struct fields to avoid considering inner fields: Issue ([#202](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/202))

## dbt-spark 0.19.1 (April 2, 2021)

## dbt-spark 0.19.1b2 (February 26, 2021)

### Under the hood

- Update serialization calls to use new API in dbt-core `0.19.1b2` ([#150](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/150))

## dbt-spark 0.19.0.1 (February 26, 2021)

### Fixes

- Fix package distribution to include incremental model materializations ([#151](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/151), [#152](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/issues/152))

## dbt-spark 0.19.0 (February 21, 2021)

### Breaking changes

- Incremental models have `incremental_strategy: append` by default. This strategy adds new records without updating or overwriting existing records. For that, use `merge` or `insert_overwrite` instead, depending on the file format, connection method, and attributes of your underlying data. dbt will try to raise a helpful error if you configure a strategy that is not supported for a given file format or connection. ([#140](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/140), [#141](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/141))

### Fixes

- Capture hard-deleted records in snapshot merge, when `invalidate_hard_deletes` config is set ([#109](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/143), [#126](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/144))

## dbt-spark 0.19.0rc1 (January 8, 2021)

### Breaking changes

- Users of the `http` and `thrift` connection methods need to install extra requirements: `pip install dbt-spark[PyHive]` ([#109](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/109), [#126](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/126))

### Under the hood

- Enable `CREATE OR REPLACE` support when using Delta. Instead of dropping and recreating the table, it will keep the existing table, and add a new version as supported by Delta. This will ensure that the table stays available when running the pipeline, and you can track the history.
- Add changelog, issue templates ([#119](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/119), [#120](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/120))

### Fixes

- Handle case of 0 retries better for HTTP Spark Connections ([#132](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/132))

- Support complete atomic overwrite of non-partitioned incremental models ([#117](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/117))
- Update to support dbt-core 0.18.1 ([#110](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/110), [#118](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-spark/pull/118))
