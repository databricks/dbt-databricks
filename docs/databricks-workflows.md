# Running a dbt project as a job in Databricks Workflows

Databricks Workflows is a highly-reliable, managed orchestrator that lets you author and schedule DAGs of notebooks, Python scripts as well as dbt projects as production jobs.

In this guide, you will learn how to update an existing dbt project to run as a job, retrieve dbt run artifacts using the Jobs API and debug common issues.

# Overview

When you run a dbt project as a Databricks Job, the dbt CLI runs on a single-node Automated Cluster. The SQL generated by dbt runs on a serverless SQL warehouse.

# Prerequisites

- An existing dbt project version controlled in git
- Access to a Databricks workspace
- Access to an existing interactive cluster with `dbt-core` and `dbt-databricks` libraries installed or `CAN_MANAGE` permissions to install the `dbt-core` and `dbt-databricks` as cluster libraries OR
- Access to serverless SQL warehouses. See [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/serverless-compute/index.html) to learn more about this feature and regional availability.
- [Files in Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html#enable-support-for-arbitrary-files-in-databricks-repos) must be enabled and is only supported on Databricks Runtime (DBR) 8.4+ or DBR 11+ depending on the configuration. Please make sure the cluster has the appropriate DBR version.
- Install and configure the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html)
- Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/), a popular open source tool for parsing JSON from the command line

Note: previously dbt tasks on Databricks Workflows could run using jobs clusters.
That is no longer supported and will result in getting a 403 response when attempted.

# Run dbt as a production job

In this step, you will create a job that will run the dbt project on a schedule.

## Connect Databricks to Git

The dbt task only supports retrieve dbt projects from Git. Please follow [the documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html#configure-your-git-integration-with-databricks) to connect Databricks to Git.

## Create a job

1. Log in to your Databricks workspace
2. Click the _Data Science & Engineering_ persona in the left navigation bar
3. Click _Workflows_
4. Click _Create Job_
5. Click _Type_ and choose _dbt_
6. Click _Edit_ next to "Git provider"
7. In the dialog, enter your Git repository URL, and choose the Git provider. Also, choose a branch / tag / commit e.g. `main`.
8. If your dbt project is in the root of the git repository, leave the _Path_ field empty. Otherwise, provide the relative path e.g. `/my/relative/path`.
9. You can customize dbt commands as needed, including any flag accepted by the dbt CLI.

10. Under _SQL warehouse_, choose the serverless SQL warehouse where SQL generated by dbt will run. You can optionally choose a custom catalog and schema where tables and views will be created.
11. By default, Databricks installs a recent version of `dbt-databricks` from PyPi, which will also install `dbt-spark` as well as `dbt-core`. You can customize this version if you wish.
12. You can customize the Automated Cluster if you wish by clicking _Edit_ in the dbt CLI cluster dropdown.
13. Click _Save_

# Run the job and view dbt output

You can now run your newly-saved job and see its output.

1. Click _Run Now_ on the notification that shows up when you save the job
2. Click the active run and see dbt output. Note that dbt output is not real-time, it lags behind dbt's progress by several seconds to a minute.

# Retrieve dbt artifacts using the Jobs API

A dbt run generates useful artifacts which you may want to retrieve for analysis and more. Databricks saves the contents of `/logs` and `/target` directories as a compressed archive which you can retrieve using the Jobs API.

> It is currently not possible to refer to a previous run's artifacts e.g. using the `--state` flag. You can, however, include a known good state in your repository.

> [dbt-artifacts](https://github.com/brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts) is a popular dbt package for ingesting dbt artifacts into tables. This is currently not supported on Databricks. Please contact us if you are interested in Databricks supporting this package.

Follow these steps to retrieve dbt artifacts from a job run:

1. Go to a job in Databricks and copy the _Task Run ID_. It appears in the sidebar under _Task run details_ when you click on a run.
2. Enter the following command in your terminal:

```nofmt
$ databricks jobs configure --version=2.1
$ databricks runs get --run-id TASK_RUN_ID | jq .tasks
```

3. The above command will return an array of tasks with their `run_id`s. Find the dbt task's `run_id` and run this command:

```nofmt
$ DBT_ARTIFACT_URL="$(databricks runs get-output --run-id DBT_TASK_RUN_ID | jq -r .dbt_output.artifacts_link)"
$ curl $DBT_ARTIFACT_URL --output artifact.tar.gz
```

On macOS or Linux, you can run the following command to expand and decompress the archive:

```nofmt
$ tar -xvf artifact.tar.gz
```

# Common issues

## Unable to connect to Databricks

- If you do not use the automatically-generated `profiles.yml`, check your Personal Access Token (PAT). It must not be expired.
- Consider adding `dbt debug` as the first command. This may give you a clue about the failure.

## dbt cannot find my `dbt_project.yml` file

If you have checked out the Git repository before enabling the _Files in Repos_ feature, the checkout might be cached invalidly. You need to push a dummy commit to your repository to force a fresh checkout.

# Connecting to different sources (custom profile)

By default the dbt task type will connect to the serverless SQL warehouse specified in the task without any configuration changes or need to check in any secrets. It does so by generating a default `profiles.yml` and telling dbt to use it. We have no restrictions on connection to any other dbt targets such as Databricks SQL, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, or any other [supported adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/available-adapters).

The automatically generated profile can be overridden by specifying an alternative profiles directory in the dbt command using `--profiles-dir <dir>`, where the path of the `<dir>` should be a relative path like `.` or `./my-directory`.

If you'd like to connect to multiple outputs and including the current Interactive Cluster as one of those, the following configuration can be used without exposing any secrets:

> Note: You cannot connect to an Automated Cluster.

```yaml
databricks_demo:
  target: databricks_cluster
  outputs:
    databricks_cluster:
      type: databricks
      connect_retries: 5
      connect_timeout: 180
      schema: "<your-schema>"
      threads: 8 # This can be increased or decreased to control the parallism
      host: "{{ env_var('DBT_HOST') }}"
      http_path: "sql/protocolv1/o/{{ env_var('DBT_ORG_ID') }}/{{ env_var('DBT_CLUSTER_ID') }}"
      token: "{{ env_var('DBT_ACCESS_TOKEN') }}"
```
